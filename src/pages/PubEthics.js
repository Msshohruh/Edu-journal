          Editorial policy of the Journal “Education and Pedagogical Sciences
          (Освіта та педагогічна наука)” is intended to comply with the ethical
          norms accepted by the international academic community.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The efforts of the Editorial Board in this regard are based on the
          recommendations of the Committee on Publication Ethics (
          <a href="http://publicationethics.org">
            http://publicationethics.org
          </a>
          ), as well as on the best practices of reputable international
          journals and publishing houses.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          The presence of new original scientific results that have never been
          published before is an essential precondition for accepting the
          article for publication.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          If the research materials have been already published, the author
          shall provide the Editorial Board with bibliographical notes on the
          previous publications and justify the relevance of the publication of
          the new variant with the explanation of the nature of the additions
          and changes in the final variant of the article.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          There are two stages of the article review before it is passed for
          publishing.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The first stage is the review of the article by a reputable scholar in
          the related field of science (doctor of science, professor) or a
          recommendation by the corresponding department (to be submitted along
          with the article).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The second stage is the review of the article by the members of the
          Editorial Board of the Journal and their decision to put the article
          into print.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Controversies of any nature (financial, academic, personal, etc.) are
          examined in detail by the members of the Editorial Board. In case of
          the confirmation of the suspicion of plagiarism or falsification of
          research results, the article is rejected with prejudice.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          All ethics issues that arise between the authors and the Editorial
          Board of the Journal and that are not stipulated in this document are
          regulated by the international standards of COPE ( Committee on
