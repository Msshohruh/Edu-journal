        The first issue of the Journal "Education and Pedagogical Sciences" is
        in front of you. This is not a new journal, and not a new project, but
        the 150th anniversary issue of the Ukrainian scientific and
        methodological Journal "Education in Donbas Region", the edition
        successfully combining the best traditions of the national pedagogy of
        the 1920s and the guidelines of the leading-edge educational theory and
        practice of the 21st Century.

        In 1922 in Bakhmut, the capital of Donetsk guberniya (now Artemivs'k),
        the first issue of "Donbas Education" was published. In those years, it
        was just about the only communication vehicle of government agencies
        with schools and teachers. However, three years after its foundation,
        the Journal still could not measure up to the level of a scientific and
        methodological publication; therefore, in 1925, the Editorial Office was
        transferred to Luhansk, where the Donetsk Institute of National
        Education could pride itself on the best research and teaching staff. In
        1925, the Journal launched a publication in Ukrainian titled " Soviet
        School " as the official journal of the District Department of Education
        and Donetsk Institute of National Education (DINE). In 1930, in
        accordance with the administrative-territorial reform, the Journal was
        completely handed over to the Institute. However, as soon as in 1931,
        due to the aggravation of the drastic monopolization and repression
        policy of the Soviet state, the publication of the Journal was
        suspended, just like many other regional publications of that time in
        the former Soviet Union. Nonetheless, nine years of productive work
        allowed 86 issues to come out. At that time, the Journal was one of the
        best pedagogical publications in Ukraine , the center of scientific and
        pedagogical thought of Donbas region. It featured the articles of the
        leaders of education, such as H. Hrynko, Ya. Ryappo, M. Skrypnyk,
        prominent scientists of DINE, teachers, such as S. Hrushevsky, Ye.
        Kaharova, F. Belsky, N. Dadenkova, O. Hraborova, S. Loktyusheva, O.
        Fihurina and others.

        In 2001, the creative teaching team of the then Luhansk Taras Shevchenko
        National Pedagogical University resumed publication of the honored
        Journal. It was not a mere tribute to traditions. As the publisher was a
        pedagogical university, the ambition of the editorial staff was to
        provide a forum for lecturers, teachers, which could be useful for the
        faculty of the regional higher educational institutions and bring
        pedagogical science closer to schools. This goal was achieved
        successfully, and the growing subscription was the best testimony to
        that. Among the Journal's constant readers are almost all educational
        institutions of Luhansk and Donetsk regions.

        Nowadays, the Journal has undergone significant changes. Its founder and
        publisher is now a classical university â€“ Luhansk Taras Shevchenko
        National University . Its Editorial Board is comprised of famous
        Ukrainian educators and scientists, such as V. Kremen, O. Sukhomlynska,
        as well as foreign scholars: V. Danilchenko, Ph. Fluri, Ph. Gabriel, G.
        Yuhai, G. Hagerty, M. Sergeyev, E. Tontu. The subject matter of the
        Journal has considerably widened. The publication covers and discusses
        the operation and interaction of educational establishments within the
        Common European Educational Space, etc.

        University faculty and, especially, the editorial staff are aware of the
        challenges in front of them, the most ambitious being the entering of
        the global educational and informational space. But nearly 100-year
        history of the University and the experienced Editorial Board are the
        safeguards of success in undertaking this task. Together, we can expand
        the horizons of the pedagogical science and practice.
